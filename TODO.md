# TODO

## Preprocessor

Add sequences and instantiations for `Histogram<n>` types and update the `PCLP_INVOKE_WITH_*` macros accordingly. This is needed for passing RIFT features between filters.

## OpenNi Source

* Expose all parameters via proxy (RGB & depth camera focal distances and modes).

# Bugs

* Normal "downcasting" fails to preserve RGB data.
